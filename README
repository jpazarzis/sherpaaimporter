A coding a assignment for SHERPAA
==================================

There are two repos containing the solution.

In this repo: https://github.com/jpazarzis/sherpaaimporter (which the current one),
 I implemented the necessary utilities to send the CSV data to the the server.

In this repo: https://github.com/jpazarzis/sherpaa_code_sample I implemented the necessary server- side changes.

To run the sample you need to clone both repos and call 

sudo python setup.py  develop

under the sherpaaimporter directory.

The script to import the data is importer.py

The unit tests exist under sherpaautils/tests and can be run using nosetests
